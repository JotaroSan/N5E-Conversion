NON-ENHANCED ITEMS </p><p>You can craft unenhanced objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. </p><p>You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan or crafting tools). </p><p>You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. </p><p>For example, someone proficient with crafting tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. </p><p>For every week of downtime, you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 100 Ryo, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. </p><p>If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 100 Ryo, you make progress every Week in 100 Ryo increments until you reach the market value of the item. </p><p>For example, a Reinforced Chunin Jacket (market value 750 Ryo) takes 8-weeks to craft by yourself. </p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. </p><p>Each character contributes 100 Ryo worth of effort for every week spent helping to craft the item. </p><p>For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a Reinforced Chunin Jacket plus another item worth 150 Ryo in 3 weeks, at a total cost of 900 Ryo. </p><p>While crafting, you automatically maintain a modest lifestyle. </p><p>If you have expertise in your chosen tool, you increase the market value of an item you can craft to 150 per week, instead of 100. </p><p>If a creature with expertise helps another creature craft an item they contribute 150 Ryo worth of effort to each week of crafting. </p><p>If a crafter is in a hurry, they can attempt to craft an item even faster than what they normally would be able to. </p><p>This is called Swift Crafting. </p><p>By spending an additional Charge of their chosen kit, they increase the market value they contribute to build time by 100 Ryo, per charge spent. </p><p>Alternatively, a crafter can make a Strength or Intelligence (Armorsmith or Weaponsmith Kit) check vs a Swift Craft DC found on the Kits Variant Chart. </p><p>On a success, they gain a +100 Ryo Bonus for every +5 they get over the listed DC. </p><p></p><p>ARMOR/WEAPON QUALITIES</p><p>All armor and weapons listed in this book are listed at their base quality which, for the most part are made my skill craftsman, but at not the best possible quality that they could be. </p><p>These base quality arms and armaments are great for the average shinobi and should by extension be used by the vast majority, but there are better quality versions of the same equipment. </p><p>While these better-quality arms are not going to provide a boost to a user’s AC or To-hit or damage when used, it does provide a much more stable base to work with when adding Enhancement seals to them. </p><p>These items for the most part are not normally sold in most shops and in most cases must be made from scratch. </p><p>There are some shops that can provide better quality equipment but they are few and far between. </p><p>The following are the qualities that can be applied to standard weapons and armor; Greater, Superior, Supreme and Mastercraft. </p><p>Greater. </p><p>This item is made with fine materials and metals. </p><p>Weapons with this quality is counted as being 5x more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Armor with this quality is counted as being 50% more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Items with this quality has 5 Enhancement Seal slots that can be applied to them. </p><p>Superior. </p><p>This item is made with rare materials generally only found in hostile environments such as active volcanoes, mines and caves miles underwater, and in ancient Shinobi or Sage ruins. </p><p>Weapons with this quality is counted as being 7x more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Armor with this quality is counted as being 70% more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Items with this quality has 7 Enhancement Seal slots that can be applied to them. </p><p>Supreme. </p><p>This item is made with endangered materials generally only found in A and S-Rank hostile environments such as active volcano's miles underwater, guarded by exiled sage beasts or ancient Sage ruins protected by powerful Sage art barriers. </p><p>Crafting an item of this quality requires Expertise with the required Tool Kit. </p><p>Weapons with this quality is counted as being 10x more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Armor with this quality is counted as being 100% more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Items with this quality has 9 Enhancement Seal slots that can be applied to them. </p><p>This item is made with materials generally only provided by extraplanar creatures such as Sage Beasts, Demons, Devils or even Ōtsutsuki. </p><p>Very, very few Items with this quality has ever been seen or used, with even less being made by Shinobi hands. </p><p>Crafting an item of this quality requires 3 creatures with Expertise with the Crafting Skill and the required Tool Kit. </p><p>Weapons with this quality is counted as being 15x more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Armor with this quality is counted as being 150% more expensive than their base price. </p><p>Items with this quality has 11 Enhancement Seal slots that can be applied to them. </p><p></p><p>CRAFTING CHAKRA- ENHANCED ITEMS </p><p>You can craft Chakra Enhanced objects, including Jutsu Scrolls and Chakra-Enhanced Weapons. </p><p>You must be proficient with a Weaponsmith Kit or Armorsmith Kit and be able to access a Sealsmith Forge. </p><p>A Sealsmith forge is a special location dedicated towards modifying and augmenting normally mundane weapons and tools. </p><p>The process to create a Chakra enhanced item can feel long or arduous. </p><p>While unlike normal Crafting where you need raw materials and a forge to melt down different materials to get the required results, this is less of an art and more focused in the realm of both Alchemy and science. </p><p>When you want to craft a chakra enhanced item you must first begin to decide on how you wish to upgrade this weapon by spending 1 Week of Downtime to find the required materials for the Seal you wish to carve into your weapon or armor. </p><p>All but the most legendary or even sentient weapons and armor can be infused with an Enhancement seal. </p><p></p><p>ENHANCEMENT SEAL </p><p>An Enhancement seal is a special form of Fuinjutsu that combine blacksmithing with Ninshou Seal weaving. </p><p>Enhancement seals are what make Chakra Enhanced weapons so special. </p><p>All base mundane weapons and armor have the potential to have up to 3 Seals imbued upon them. </p><p>This seal allotment is coequally known as Seal Slots. </p><p>These Seals are organized in the standard Rank System that proliferates the Shinobi World of D-Rank all the way up to S-Rank. </p><p>Each seal tier have their own list of Seal, their own Ryo Cost, and some seals even increase the difficulty to infuse them onto your item of choice. </p><p>Much like Ninjutsu, shinobi must be of appropriate level in order to utilize and in many cases, even wield Chakra Enhanced weapons. </p><p>In order to wield these weapons, you must be of the appropriate level. </p><p>If even one seal infused on your weapon is of a higher rank, the weapon is counted as the highest rank imbued on it. </p><p>While most seals do not increase difficulty there is a standard Difficultly level based on the Rank of the chosen seal. </p><p>Unlike normal Crafting when you are imbuing an item if you fail the Ability check, you don’t lose out on all the material or cost, you instead lose time. </p><p>You waste the Downtime spent working on the item, and must commit at least half of the listed time again towards recreating the seals. </p><p>with an Enhancement seal, you must be mindful of a few restrictions; • Seals of the Same name, do not stack. </p><p>• Seals of different names, do stack. </p><p>• Your weapon carries the same Downtime cost as the highest ranked Seal being imbued on your item. </p><p>• Regardless of who makes this item, if the wielder is not of the appropriate level, they do not gain proficiency with the weapon regardless of outside features of effects. </p><p>Additionally, if it is armor, they do not gain the benefit of the armor’s new effects. </p><p>• You must be proficient with the imbued item in order to use it effectively. </p><p>Seals of different ranks, occupy more of your weapons or armors Seal slots based on the rank of the seal. </p><p>So be sure to plan ahead. </p><p>Finally, different seals regardless of rank carry their own Ryo cost to have them imbued. </p><p>Normally the cost located in the Seals description is how much the seals materials cost in the market place for you to craft yourself. </p><p>But if you wish to pay for someone else, such as a Sealsmith to imbue your weapons for you, there is a premium on this service. </p><p>Increase the cost of your chosen seal(s) by 50%.</p><img src=\"worlds/ryuvillage/assets/pages/zLqQekWx5V50uSeF-pages-M7pWTavNMNafsdxD-image-l3bCkKklHXQoFyxY.png\" /><img

{"name":"World & Lore","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Secret Villages","type":"text","_id":"3sNYfXVJfnO8XVb0","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1><strong>The Big Five:</strong></h1><p>These are the villages with a \"Kage\" that is recognized by the council of kages.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Sunagakure</strong></h3><p>Sunagakure (砂隠れの里, Sunagakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Sand) is the hidden village of the Land of Wind. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Sunagakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Kazekage, of which there have been five in its history. Being surrounded by desert offers the village a natural deterrent against invasion, as few foreign powers would be willing to endure the sandstorms and water scarcity common to Suna. Sunagakure itself lies in a fortified valley behind cliffs of rock, with passage in and out of the village restricted to a single cleft between two cliff faces, making the area very hard to attack from the ground. The buildings inside seem to be made of clay or stucco, which would help to keep the buildings cool.</p><p>The standard attire for Suna shinobi consists of blue or black uniforms underneath flak jackets of various shades of beige to better blend with their natural environment and include shoulders guards. Headpieces consisting of a head-wrap and cloth neck-covers to protect against the harsh weather are popular with Suna shinobi. Many Sunagakure ninja use Wind Release techniques, which they may or may not perform with fans. Shinobi from this village believe that the accomplishment of a mission predominates the lives of the ninja trying to accomplish it. As such, they ruthlessly pursue victory in battle, and even if failure is inevitable they will still try to achieve any success against their enemy that they can. In Gaara Hiden, it has been noted that Sunagakure has been made up of various families, instead of clans.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Iwagakure</strong></h3><p>Iwagakure (岩隠れの里, Iwagakure no Sato, English TV: Hidden Stone Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Rocks) is the hidden village of the Land of Earth. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Iwagakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Tsuchikage, of which there have been four in its history. The rocky mountain ranges that surround the village provide a natural stronghold that it is very proud of. The village's infrastructure is built from much of the surrounding rock and stone, shaped into tower-like structures that are inter-connected by a network of bridges. The Tsuchikage's residence seems to be the tallest structure with a cone-shaped roof and bears the kanji for \"Earth\" (土, Tsuchi) on it.</p><p>The standard attire for Iwa shinobi consists of red outfit — which can either have one, or both sleeves — a lapel which is usually found on the side without a sleeve and a brown flak jacket — which also may, or may not have a pouch attached to it. They also tend to wear mesh armour around their ankles. Many Iwagakure ninja use Earth Release techniques. Iwagakure is well-known for the rock-hard attitude of its shinobi; as soon as the Tsuchikage gives an order, the Iwa-nin follow it without hesitation, even if it means death.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Kirigakure</strong></h3><p>Kirigakure (霧隠れの里, Kirigakure no Sato, English TV: Village Hidden in the Mist, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Mist) is the hidden village of the Land of Water. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Kiri has a Kage as its leader known as the Mizukage, of which there have been six in its history. Befitting its name, the village is surrounded by a thick mist, with several mountains in the background, making it difficult to find by foreigners. Kirigakure's architecture is composed of several cylindrical buildings, with the Mizukage's office being the widest and largest. Most of the buildings have vegetation growing on their roofs.</p><p>The standard attire for Kiri shinobi revolves around a pinstriped material which the shinobi wear as bracers and greaves which merge into their sandals. Underneath this, they wear a full-black shirt and pants over which they wear the villages' standard grey flak jacket. Some also wear waist-guards. Many Kiri ninja use Water Release techniques. Due to the village's high number of missing-nin, Kiri has a subdivision of Anbu known as hunter-nin that are specifically tasked with eliminating these defectors.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Konohagakure</strong></h3><p>Konohagakure (木ノ葉隠れの里, Konohagakure no Sato, English TV: \"Village Hidden in the Leaves\" or \"Hidden Leaf Village\", literally meaning: Village Hidden by Tree Leaves) is the hidden village of the Land of Fire. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Konohagakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Hokage, of which there have been seven in its history. Konoha resides deep within a forest at the base of a mountain known as the Hokage Rock, which has the faces of all those who have taken the office of Hokage engraved on it.[1] It is surrounded on all sides by enormous walls.[2] While generally seen as the most powerful of the ninja villages,[3] Konoha has enjoyed many years of relative peace and stability.</p><p>The standard attire for Konoha shinobi consists of blue or black shirts which may or may not have swirl patterns on the shoulders, along with matching coloured pants under a green flak jacket which also has a red swirl on the back, and pockets on the chest area. They also tend to wrap bandages around their legs. Many Konohagakure ninja use Fire Release techniques.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Kumogakure</strong></h3><p>Kumogakure (雲隠れの里, Kumogakure no Sato, English TV: Hidden Cloud Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Clouds) is the hidden village of the Land of Lightning and was founded by the First Raikage. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Kumogakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Raikage, of which there have been five in its history. The village is located in a range of tall mountains, and is literally hidden in the clouds. The Raikage works in a large blue structure built into the tallest mountain.</p><p>The standard attire for Kumo shinobi consists of a long, grey top which gathers just at the waist to give a sash-like appearance, with a matching coloured bottom. Over this they wear white, one-strapped flak jackets and arm as well as shin-guards. Many Kumogakure ninja use Lightning Release techniques.</p><p></p><hr /><p></p><h1><strong>OTHER VILLAGES:</strong></h1><p></p><h3><strong>Amegakure</strong></h3><p>Amegakure (雨隠れの里, Amegakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Rain) is a small but highly industrialised hidden village located in an unnamed country. As its name suggests, it rains almost constantly in Amegakure and the surrounding area. All the water seemingly ends in a large lake that surrounds the village.</p><p>Ame ninja are said to be notoriously short tempered, while their village trains them to their fullest potential, resulting in the creation of many original techniques. Ame is frequently hired for assassination missions, an area of expertise prized by many countries. A common trait of shinobi from this village is wearing rebreathers. Its shinobi also have a propensity for genjutsu</p><p></p><h3><strong>Otogakure</strong></h3><p>Otogakure (音隠れの里, Otogakure no Sato, English TV: Village Hidden in the Sound, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Sound) is the personal hidden village of Orochimaru, which was founded for the express purpose of collecting ninja for his experiments and his quest to learn all techniques. In later years, following Orochimaru's new appreciation for natural development of people and making a truce with Konohagakure, Otogakure was reestablished as a legitimate shinobi village.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Shimogakure</strong></h3><div><p>Shimogakure (霜隠れの里, Shimogakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden in Frost) is the hidden village located in the Land of Frost.</p></div><p></p><h3><strong>Hoshigakure</strong></h3><p>Hoshigakure (星隠れの里, Hoshigakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden Among Stars) was introduced during the Star Guard Mission. It is founded by the First Hoshikage two hundred years before the start of the series and is located in the Land of Bears. It is also one of the lesser-known shinobi villages in the Naruto universe.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Ishigakure</strong></h3><p>Ishigakure (石隠れの里, Ishigakure no Sato, Viz: Hidden Rock Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden in Stones) is the hidden village of the country located between the Land of Earth and the Land of Wind. In Gaara Hiden, several terrorists with kekkei genkai hail from this village.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Takigakure</strong></h3><p>Takigakure (滝隠れの里, Takigakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden by a Waterfall) is a village located in an unnamed country. In terms of the village's appearance, Takigakure seems to be based on mostly Southeast Asian aesthetics. Their current leader is Shibuki.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Tanigakure</strong></h3><p>Tanigakure (谷隠れの里, Tanigakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden in Valleys) is the hidden village of the Land of Rivers.</p><p>Thirty years before the start of the series, this village ambushed Kagerō Village two weeks after they had agreed to a ceasefire with Konohagakure. Gennō is the sole survivor of that attack, as he was in Konoha at the time.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Tsukigakure</strong></h3><p>Tsukigakure (月隠れの里, Tsukigakure no Sato, English: Hidden Moon Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden under the Moon) is a hidden village led by Tsukino, who succeeded her father after he died. They have a hereditary system and so positions are passed down to the next generation.</p><p>It is a custom for the people of Tsukigakure to always give strangers and newcomers warm welcomes, because of an old ancient legend of the village.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Uzushiogakure</strong></h3><p>Uzushiogakure (渦潮隠れの里, Uzushiogakure no Sato, English TV: Hidden Eddy Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Whirling Tides) was the shinobi village of the Land of Whirlpools. Its ninja were renowned for their fūinjutsu to the point that it led to its destruction in war.[1] Those who survived the village's destruction scattered across the globe to seek refuge.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Kusagakure</strong></h3><p>Kusagakure (草隠れの里, Kusagakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden in the Grass) is located thus far in an unnamed country. Because it had genin participating in the Chūnin Exams organised by Konohagakure, it can be assumed the two villages are allied. Although it has never been named, the country Kusagakure is located in has been shown on several occasions. The country is rich with forests, some consisting of giant mushrooms or bamboo. It also seems to have many rivers and deep ravines.</p><p>During the Third Shinobi World War, the country was invaded by Iwagakure and served as an important front between Iwa and Konoha. More than a decade later, Orochimaru had a hideout somewhere in the country.[1]</p><p>Kusagakure is skilled in diplomacy, a trait they constantly use to read the movements of other countries and stay one step ahead of them. They also analyse techniques from other villages in a similar manner. Because of these principles, others find it hard to read the shinobi from this village's attitudes.[2]</p><p>After the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kusagakure was approached and offered to join the Shinobi Union.[3]</p><p></p><h3><strong>Yugakure</strong></h3><p>Yugakure (湯隠れの里, Yugakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden in Hot Water) is the hidden village of the Land of Hot Water. Like the country in which it resides, Yugakure has strong inclinations towards pacifism. After years of reluctantly offering combat-related services, Yugakure officially transitioned away from the typical shinobi missions; it prides itself as the \"village that has forgotten wars\" (戦を忘れた里, Ikusa o Wasureta Sato). The village's ninja now work almost exclusively within the Land of Hot Water's borders, keeping the roads safe for tourists and performing odd-jobs for the many small settlements around the country.</p><p>Yugakure's transformation from a military force was not supported by all, Hidan being a notable objector. A follower of Jashin, Hidan believed violence was good, even necessary; when he couldn't convince the village to change its ways, he became a missing-nin, slaughtering many of his fellow Yu-nin before he left. In Konoha Shinden, critics of Yugakure's pacifism decry it as \"Nurumayugakure\" (ぬるま湯隠れ, literally meaning: Village Hidden in Warm Water). In Sasuke Shinden, Yugakure's ninja acknowledge a flaw in its pursuit of peace, as the village has historically tended to ignore difficult subjects in order to avoid getting involved, Jashinists and the Chinoike clan being more glaring examples.</p><p>Yugakure is surrounded by several different hotsprings, and so thick steam rises up around the village. Many resort hotels are built throughout the area for the hotsprings' visitors to stay in.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Yumegakure</strong></h3><p>Yumegakure (夢隠れの里, Yumegakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden Among Dreams) is a small village located in a deep forest of a tiny country, near the border of the Land of Fire. It is led by Enzo Tenrō. Ninja of this village seem to specialise in more powerful combat-oriented versions of the Transformation Technique. The village's forehead protector bears three \"Z\" symbols.</p><p>Before its destruction by the Fake Nine-Tails, the village was positioned in a flat valley surrounded by forests and mountains, with a bridged river running through it. The buildings were similar in architectural style to those of Japan's Edo period.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Yukigakure</strong></h3><p>Yukigakure (雪隠れの里, Yukigakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden Among Snow) is a hidden village located in the Land of Snow. Its ninja apparently specialise in manipulating pre-existing ice, typically in the forms of various animals. The ninja from this village also make use of a number of sophisticated pieces of technology: First and foremost was the special \"Chakra Armour\", which protects the wearer from most attacks while amplifying the user's abilities.

task.</p><p>The character who’s leading the effort, or the one with the highest ability modifier, can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters.</p><p>In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 8).</p><p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone.</p><p>For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with security kits, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task.</p><p>Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive.</p><p>Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p><p></p><p>GROUP CHECKS</p><p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.</p><p>In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.</p><p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check.</p><p>If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.</p><p>Otherwise, the group fails.</p><p>Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group.</p><p>For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment.</p><p>If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger.</p><p>Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CASTING A JUTSU AT A HIGHER RANK </p><p></p><p>When a shinobi casts a Jutsu, that jutsu is normally locked to whatever rank it is casted it. </p><p>But in some special cases, some jutsu can be upcasted to higher ranks if you can both learn &amp; cast jutsu of at least one rank higher than the jutsu’s base rank. </p><p>As a general rule of thumb, unless stated otherwise by a class or clan feature, or a feat you can upcast jutsu to the following ranks at the appropriate levels:</p><p>• C-Rank Starting at 5th Level </p><p>• B-Rank Starting at 9th level </p><p>• A-Rank Starting at 13th level </p><p>• S-Rank Starting at 17th level </p><p></p><p>ABILITY SCORE REQUIREMENTS</p><p> In order to learn or cast a jutsu whose base rank is B-Rank or higher, you must meet a minimum ability score requirement. </p><p>This represents the characters ability to physically, mentally, or spiritually handle the stress the jutsu puts on the users bodies. </p><p>Here are the following ability score minimums for jutsu of B-Rank or higher:</p><p> • B-Rank: 14 or higher. </p><p>• A-Rank: 16 or higher. </p><p>• S-Rank: 18 or higher. </p><p>When you are calculating which ability scores need to meet the above requirements in order to cast, you only refer to the ability score used to calculate the attack and damage rolls and the Save DC for the chosen jutsu. </p><p>This rule excludes all jutsu classified as Hijutsu and jutsu which you upcast. </p><p>Hijutsu can be cast, regardless of your current ability scores, so long as all other rules and conditions are followed when adding one to your known jutsu list.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Passive

foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.</p><p>At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with

LIGHT AND SPECIAL SENSES </p><p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring-noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a power, to name just a few-rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. </p><p>Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. </p><p>A creature without any additional abilities, features or equipment, on a clear day, can see 1 mile, or until your view is obscured by terrain features. </p><p>If it's raining, it usually cuts it down to 500 feet and a light Fog cuts it down to 100 feet. </p><p>While a creature can see 1 mile on a clear day, after 500 feet they lose the ability to decern any distinguishable features such as facial expressions or fine movement from a medium sized creature. </p><p>A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. </p><p>In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. </p><p>A heavily obscured area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. </p><p>A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition. </p><p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness. </p><p>Bright light let's most creatures see normally. </p><p>Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. </p><p>Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. </p><p>An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. </p><p>The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. </p><p>A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light. </p><p>Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. </p><p>Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), or within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault. </p><p></p><p>BLINDSIGHT </p><p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. </p><p>Creatures without eyes and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses have this sense. </p><p>A creature with Blindsight can attempt the Search Action without needing to have a direct line of sight to the creature. </p><p></p><p>CHAKRA SIGHT </p><p>A creature with Chakra sight can see Chakra in its pure form. </p><p>Viewing chakra in this way allows the user to see chakra as a wavy blue aura. </p><p>Most creatures chakra are blue but there are some creatures whose chakra are distinctly different colors either due to the nature of their chakra or the technique they are using. </p><p>You can see the chakra of creatures even if they are obscured by fog, smoke, mist, darkness or even invisibility. </p><p>A creature counts as being seen by you in these conditions and do not gain advantage to make ability checks or attack rolls against you in any way. </p><p>A creature with chakra sight, cannot see another creatures chakra if, said creature is behind total cover or cannot be seen by normal or special means (Ex. </p><p>Unable to see through solid material). </p><p>A creature with chakra sight gains advantage against Genjutsu with the Visual Keyword. </p><p></p><p>DARKVISION </p><p>Many creatures within the Naruto Universe, especially those that dwell underground, have Darkvision. </p><p>Within a specified range, a creature with Darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. </p><p>However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p><p>A creature cannot attempt the Hide action against a creature with Darkvision using only Darkness. </p><p></p><p>TREMORSENSE </p><p>A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. </p><p>A creature using Tremor sense in a volatile and non-solid substance such as within water, makes any perception checks to find the source of a specific vibration at disadvantage. </p><p>A creature with Tremor sense automatically senses and observes any creature moving into or out of their tremor sense range. </p><p>Tremorsense cannot be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. </p><p>Any burrowing creatures, such as moles, have this special sense. </p><p></p><p>TRUE SIGHT </p><p>A creature with true sight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and enhanced darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shape changer or a creature that is transformed by a power.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Survival","type":"text","_id":"NYIzqRepOnUjT9mr","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>FOOD

two gallons per day if the weather is hot.</p><p>A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p><p>A character with access to less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.</p><p>If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character

creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round).</p><p>At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.</p><p>For example, a creature with a constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes.</p><p>If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p><p></p><p>FALLING</p><p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.</p><p>At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 50d6.</p><p>The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p><p>A falling creature falls 500 feet per round.</p><p></p><p>DROPPING TO 0 HIT POINTS</p><p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p><p></p><p>DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF DAMAGE</p><p>Game Masters describe hit point loss in different ways.</p><p>When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury.</p><p>When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises.</p><p>An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.</p><p></p><p>INSTANT DEATH</p><p>Massive damage can kill you instantly.</p><p>When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your point maximum.</p><p>For example, a Scout-Nin with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points.</p><p>If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains.</p><p>Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the Scout-Nin dies.</p><p></p><p>FALLING UNCONSCIOUS</p><p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to instantly kill you, you fall unconscious (see Conditions).</p><p>This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.</p><p></p><p>DEATH SAVING THROWS</p><p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life.</p><p>Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score.</p><p>You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by Jutsu and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p><p>Roll a d20.</p><p>If the roll is 10 or higher, you 8 succeed.</p><p>Otherwise, you fail.</p><p>A success or failure has no effect by itself.</p><p>On your third success, you become stable (see below).</p><p>On your third failure, you die.</p><p>The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.</p><p>The number of successful death saves are reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p><p>The number of failures do not reset until you complete a short rest.</p><p>Rolling 1 or 20.</p><p>When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.</p><p>If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point and remove two failed death saving throws from the count.</p><p>Damage at 0 Hit Points.</p><p>If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points (for example, by catching fire because your limbs were all chopped off next to a pit of lava), you suffer a death saving throw failure.</p><p>If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead.</p><p>If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.</p><p></p><p>STABILIZING A CREATURE</p><p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it.</p><p>If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p><p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p>Beating this DC by 5 or more removes one failed death save from them, if any.</p><p>A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.</p><p>The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage.</p><p>A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 8 hours.</p><p></p><p>ADVERSARIES AND DEATH</p><p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.</p><p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.</p><p></p><p>EXHAUSTION</p><p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion.</p><p>Exhaustion is measured in six levels.</p><p>An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.</p><p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.</p><p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels.</p><p>For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p><p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p><p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p><img

adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. </p><p>The character regains hit points and/or Chakra points equal to the total. </p><p>The player can decide to spend an additional Hit or chakra Die after each roll. </p><p>A character regains some spent Hit and Chakra Dice upon finishing a long or full rest, as explained below. </p><p></p><p>LONG REST </p><p>A long rest is a longer period of downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. </p><p>If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting Jutsu, or similar adventuring activity- the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. </p><p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains half of their Maximum hit and chakra points. </p><p>The character also regains half of their spent Hit and Chakra Dice. </p><p>For example, if a character has eight hit &amp; chakra Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit and chakra Dice upon finishing a long rest. </p><p>This does not Heal Conditions that may last into the Long Rest, such as the Poisoned condition. </p><p>Characters cannot gain the benefit of a long rest if they are poisoned. </p><p>A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. </p><p></p><p>FULL REST </p><p>A full rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 24 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 8-12 hours. </p><p>If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting Jutsu, or similar adventuring activity- the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it. </p><p>At the end of a full rest, a character regains their Maximum hit and chakra points. </p><p>The character also regains all of their spent Hit and Chakra Dice. </p><p>This Heals Conditions that may last into the full Rest, such as the Poisoned condition. </p><p>A character can’t benefit from more than one full rest in a 96-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Missions","type":"text","_id":"u1UmBGkDtpBlYoF1","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>CREATING MISSIONS</p><p>Building your own Mission can be excited, and even slightly intimidating, but it can allow you to express yourself, your table, and be more creative and tailor made directly to your players and their characters.</p><p>Mission Plotting can begin at many different points.</p><p>A GM might begin with a particular antagonist, then construct a mission (or group of missions) that fits that villains theme, and leads the group to them.</p><p>Alternatively, you could start with an interesting location for exploration, then populate it with adversaries and challenges appropriate to the setting.</p><p></p><p>LOCATIONS</p><p>Memorable settings that include mysterious and fantastical locations for players to visit can elicit the players’ curiosity.</p><p>Exploring each location should be a treat in itself, not just a chore the players must complete to get from one fight to the next.</p><p>As you create a locale, picture it in your mind’s eye and write down minor details you can include as you narrate the game.</p><p>Describing decorations, natural landmarks, wildlife, peculiar smells, and even temperature changes make a place feel more real.</p><p>Beyond adversaries and mission rewards, your locations can include environment-based challenges, from environmental conditions like blizzards to puzzles, traps, or other hazards.</p><p>These challenges should suit your adventure’s location: walls of brambles in a castle ruin overrun with vegetation, pools of acid in a cursed swamp, or Fuinjutsu traps in the tomb of a paranoid shinobi or sage.</p><p></p><p>ENCOUNTERS</p><p>A robust set of encounters forms the backbone of your adventure.</p><p>Encounters often feature combat with other creatures, but they can also include hazards, or you might create social encounters in which characters duel only with words.</p><p>The rules for building encounters appropriate to your group’s level begin below.</p><p>Some adventures have a clear and direct progression, with encounters occurring at specific times or in a specific order.</p><p>Others, such as a dungeon filled with interconnected rooms the group can investigate in any order, are nonlinear, and the group can face encounters in any order—or even avoid them entirely.</p><p>Most adventures are somewhere in between, with some keystone encounters you know the characters will need to contend with, but others that are optional.</p><p></p><p>MISSION BUDGET(S)</p><p>When building a Mission, it should have a pre-set budget in order to help prevent yourself from potentially overwhelming your players.</p><p>While creating a mission budget is a guideline it is not a hard or fast rule.</p><p>You have free reign to adjust whatever is needed to supplement your game and table however you see fit.</p><p>All Missions should be built with the following things in mind; • Rough number of encounters.</p><p>• Types of encounters.</p><p>• Enemy and trap choice/design.</p><p>• Plot/Narrative of the mission.</p><p>When you have these details worked out, its much easier to go about actually filling your mission out with the set pieces, enemies and environments you want your players to experience.</p><p>As a part of this change in quest/mission design, there has been a fundamental change in how mission experience is calculated to better fit this dynamic.</p><p></p><p>MISSION RANK(S)</p><p>As in the Naruto universe, quests are organized into Missions.</p><p>Single, digestible plot hooks or quest lines.</p><p>Quests in this system should, by design act in the same way to simplify the narrative structure when planning out how to set up quest lines for your party.</p><p>Unlike in normal Dungeons and Dragons where the players do not have clear and defined quest difficulty, quests in this system are broken up into Ranks, and then further broken down into three tiers within each rank.</p><p>The 5 Mission ranks are very similar to that of Jutsu Ranks.</p><p>D-Rank, C-Rank, B-Rank, A-Rank and S-Rank.</p><p></p><p>D-Rank.</p><p>The lowest classification a mission can have.</p><p>These missions are normally assigned to Genin and are mostly seen as problem solvers.</p><p>Most D-Rank missions are mission that are not expected to have combat, but if any combat is to be had, its expected that it be minor or of no consequence.</p><p></p><p>C-Rank.</p><p>These missions are normally assigned to experienced Genin or Low to medium experience Chunin.</p><p>Some of these assignments can include combat in addition to fixing issues of significance.</p><p>These missions normally pose threats to the shinobi taking these missions on.</p><p></p><p>B-Rank.</p><p>These missions are normally assigned to Experienced Chunin or Jonin.</p><p>These Assignments can include spying or even assignation.</p><p>These missions expect a shinobi to enter combat with opposing shinobi over the course of the mission.</p><p></p><p>A-Rank.</p><p>These missions are normally reserved for Jonin or even Kage level shinobi, similar to that of a Sanin or Seven Swordsman.</p><p>These missions generally relate to what is in a villages or countries personal interest and are normally extremely difficult, dangerous or time consuming.</p><p>These missions can take days, weeks months or in rare cases years to complete depending on the complexity of the request.</p><p></p><p>S-Rank.</p><p>These are the most dangerous missions a shinobi can take on.</p><p>These missions are exclusively assigned to highly skilled jonin or large squads of shinobi.</p><p>These mission can include hunting down extremely dangerous criminals in the same tier or greater than the likes of Akatsuki or Orochimaru.</p><p>MISSION TIER(S) Missions, while broken into 5 distinct classifications can also be further broken into 3 distinct tiers within their given Ranks.</p><p></p><p>Trivial.</p><p>Missions that are labeled as trivial are considered very easy for the rank its considered.</p><p>This does alter the Experience (XP) offered to the players, while also making things easier in relation to other missions of the same rank.</p><p></p><p>Moderate.</p><p>Missions that are labeled as moderate are basically the normal difficulty for a mission.</p><p>This tier offers no alteration to Experience (XP) values.</p><p></p><p>Extreme.</p><p>Missions that are labeled as extreme are considered extremely difficult for the rank it is labeled as.</p><p>This mission is borderline creeping into the next rank in terms of expectations.</p><p></p><p>MISSION XP/RYO/DOWNTIME CALCULATION</p><p>When you are deciding on a mission Rank and tier, you are pre-emptively deciding on the Experience (XP) budget for the mission as well as the Downtime and Ryo rewards for completing the mission.</p><p>The following are the base experience (XP) budgets, Ryo and downtime reward ranges and are based on the base ranks of the mission taken; • D-Rank: 300 XP, 50~200 Ryo, 2~5 (1d4+1) Downtime.</p><p>• C-Rank: 600 XP, 200~500 Ryo, 3~8 (1d6+2) Downtime.</p><p>• B-Rank: 900 XP, 500~1,500 Ryo, 5~11 (2d4+3) Downtime.</p><p>• A-Rank: 1200 XP, 1,500~5,000 Ryo, 7~16 (3d4+4) Downtime.</p><p>• S-Rank: 1500 XP, 5,000~10,000 Ryo, 9~21 (4d4+5) Downtime.</p><p>Once a mission rank is decided, you can then take the next step in deciding on the tier of the mission.</p><p>Depending 56 on the tier of the mission you increase the values of all budgets and rewards based on the tier.</p><p></p><p>• Trivial: Reduce all values by 25%, Reduce all adversary levels by 2.</p><p></p><p>• Moderate: No Change.</p><p>All adversaries are the same level of players.</p><p></p><p>• Extreme.</p><p>Increase all Values by 25%, Increase all adversary levels by 2.</p><p></p><p>PURCHASING ENCOUNTERS</p><p>Once you have the experience (XP) budget set, the next thing that you should do is figure out what type of encounters you want in your mission.</p><p>You can figure this out by purchasing different types of encounters that you can tweak to fit your campaigns narrative or theme.</p><p>Encounters do not need to always be combat and can instead by social or even environmental.</p><p>The following are the different types of encounters that can be purchased and what they can entail.</p><p>If a particular Encounter multiplies its XP by the rank of the mission it is multiplied by the following values (D-Rank: 1, C-Rank:2, B- Rank: 3, A-Rank: 4, S-Rank:5)</p><p></p><p>SOCIAL ENCOUNTERS:</p><p>• Hostile Social Encounter: 10xp times the rank of the mission.</p><p>These encounters are meant to represent aggressive discussions with potentially hostile creatures or groups.</p><p>The focus of this encounter should be to potentially avoid conflict by disarming the situation or even potentially escaping.</p><p></p><p>• Diplomatic Social Encounter: 10xp times the rank of the mission.</p><p>These encounters are meant to represent discussions with neutral creatures or groups.</p><p>The focus of this encounter can be to convince a group to aid you, or even dissuade a group from becoming hostile towards another party.</p><p></p><p>• Intrigue Social Encounter: 10xp times the rank of the mission.</p><p>These encounters are meant to represent discussions with dodgy or even dishonest creatures or groups.</p><p>The focus of this encounter can be to learn the truth of an event or gain a bit more information into said event that you previously lacked.</p><p></p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL ENCOUNTERS:</p><p>• Traps: 5xp times the rank of the mission.</p><p>These encounters are meant to represent any number of traps.</p><p>Traps can include spiked pits, laser monitoring systems, flamethrower hallways etc.</p><p>Players are challenged in disarming, avoiding or finding a way through the traps suffering as few casualties or damage as possible.</p><p></p><p>• Environmental Hazards: 10xp times the rank of the mission.</p><p>These encounters are meant to represent fighting against the natural environment.</p><p>This can involve avoiding Lava, maneuvering up or around a waterfall, or even making your way through a thick brush that are coated in poison ivy.</p><p></p><p>• Puzzle(s): 10xp time the rank of the mission.</p><p>These encounters are meant to represent facing a challenging Puzzle.</p><p>These puzzles can be actual puzzles or narrative puzzles that require a skill check to solve.</p><p></p><p>• Stealth Encounter: 25xp.</p><p>These encounters are meant to represent when the players must maneuver through a certain area or room garnering as little attention from hostile or even 3rd party creatures as possible.</p><p></p><p>COMBAT ENCOUNTERS:</p><p>• Minions: 1xp.</p><p>Minions are inconsequential.</p><p>Minions should be purchased in bulk, 5 at a time in order to avoid weird math.</p><p>It’s much easier to purchase 5 minions per player, if you want to use minions.</p><p></p><p>• Standard: 10xp.</p><p>Standard adversaries are nominal challenges.</p><p>Standard adversaries are roughly equal to 1 player character in power.</p><p>So, purchase 1 for every player and assign them to different teams with an equal number of adversaries as there are player in a time.</p><p></p><p>• Elites: 25xp.</p><p>Elite Adversaries are difficult and challenging foes.</p><p>These adversaries are roughly equal to two player characters in power.</p><p>So, purchase 1 for every 2 players currently active in a team.</p><p></p><p>• Solo: 100xp.</p><p>Solo Adversaries are extremely powerful and challenging foes.</p><p>These adversaries should have the power required to do battle with all of the player characters at once.</p><p>For the most part Solo adversaries, are adversaries that should show up only during the conclusion of a mission as the final Boss fight of the mission or campaign.</p><p></p><p>DISTRIBUTING XP AND REWARDS</p><p>Once players have completed a mission, you should distribute all the rewards as follows; Total mission XP.</p><p>Split evenly amongst all active players.</p><p>NPC’s should not have XP split with them.</p><p>Total Ryo.</p><p>All active players should receive the listed Ryo value.</p><p>A failed mission causes the party to only be paid for 50% of the mission offer.</p><p>Total Downtime.</p><p>All active players should receive the decided upon Downtime regardless of a successful mission or a failed mission.</p><p></p><img

MISSIONS</p><p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure.</p><p>Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned ryo.</p><p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description.</p><p>When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing.</p><p>At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p><p></p><p>GAINING DOWNTIME</p><p>Downtime is a measure of time that is used in-between your missions and adventures.</p><p>DM’s are encouraged to provide players with Downtime after every mission or Adventure to some degree.</p><p>Normally Downtime is provided in a count of single days, but that can be easily seen as too cumbersome.</p><p>In Naruto 5E, DM’s and Players are provided Downtime in the form of Weeks, a 7-day collection of time.</p><p>The minimum amount of downtime a player can be given is 1 week.</p><p>Downtime activities are spent in weeks, usually 8-10 hours of day working on the activity, with the remaining time doing other things such as sleeping, spending time with NPC’s or other minor activities but the lion's share being performing your chosen activity.</p><p></p><p>LIFESTYLE EXPENSES</p><p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.</p><p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you.</p><p>For example, when you lead a wealthy lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p><img src=\"worlds/ryuvillage/assets/pages/84oFprEaZ9Ytz4ju-pages-hVmfVcB1Rvw62x0l-image-TetPrzBoekLBGsOT.png\" /><p>LIFESTYLE EXPENSES DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES</p><p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime.</p><p>Periods of downtime are always in the form a Weeks (1 Week, 2 Weeks, or even 12 Weeks) but each downtime activity requires a certain number of weeks to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8-10 hours of each day within the week, must be spent on the downtime activity for the week to count.</p><p>The weeks do not need to be consecutive.</p><p>If you have more than the minimum number of weeks to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p><p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible.</p><p>If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p><p></p><p>DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES CAROUSING</p><p>You choose whether to spend time with the lower, middle, or upper class, costing 10, 50, and 250 Ryo per week respectively.</p><p>If you want to spend time with the upper class, you'll either need access to the local nobility or be disguised with one.</p><p>During the week you mingle, party, and socialize with members of that social class.</p><p>At the end of the week, you gain a number of contacts within that class.</p><p>Some examples are criminals in the lower class, soldiers in the middle class, and nobles in the upper class.</p><p>This option is great for collecting allies and intel, especially if you are new to the area.</p><p>If your character is a charismatic one who needs information, then you should carouse as much as you can.</p><p></p><img src=\"worlds/ryuvillage/assets/pages/84oFprEaZ9Ytz4ju-pages-hVmfVcB1Rvw62x0l-image-HwdHNl3VNH48wzP1.png\" /><p></p><p>RECUPERATING</p><p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p><p>After 1 Week of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.</p><p>On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results: </p><p>• End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</p><p>• For the next week, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</p><p></p><p>RESEARCHING</p><p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign.</p><p>Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.</p><p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many weeks of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location).</p><p>The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid.</p><p>Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.</p><p></p><p>SHOPPING</p><p>You can use downtime between adventures to go on a little shopping spree looking for the best possible deals on the items you are looking to buy.</p><p>For 1 week of downtime, you search high and low, potentially traveling to other villages, towns, or cities to find the items you are looking for.</p><p>Items you find have a 5d4 percent price reduction in the shop they reside in due to your dedication to looking for a good deal.</p><p></p><p>TRAINING</p><p>You can spend time between adventures, learning a new language, training with a set of tools, gaining a new Feat, or Learning a new Weapon.</p><p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you.</p><p>The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.</p><p>Generally, training time is as follows for the following and each costs 100 Ryo per week.</p><p>This can be adjusted by the GM as needed:</p><p> • 3 Weeks: New Tool or Vehicle Proficiency </p><p>• 5 Weeks: New Weapon or Language Proficiency.</p><p>• 10 Weeks: New Armor Proficiency </p><p>• 15 Weeks: New Skill Proficiency </p><p>• 25 Weeks: New
